# Setup Android emulator

The GLES3 setting needs to be enabled from the Android Emulator settings:

*Before you can access this, you'll need to make sure that your Android emulator isn't in an integrated tool window in Android Studio.  If it is, you can pull it out into a separate window by closing the tab (if active), going to File -> Settings -> Tools -> Emulator, and uncheck Launch in a tool window.  Press OK once this is complete.*

From there, click on Settings, Advanced, and you should be able to see what GLES API Level you're using.
